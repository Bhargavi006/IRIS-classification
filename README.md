# IRIS-classification
This Project focuses on IRIS flower classification using Machine Learning with scikit tools.It is classified into 3 classes: Iris virginica, Iris setosa and Iris versicolor based on 4 features as Sepal length, Sepal width, Petal length and Petal width. Some of the supervised and Unsupervised learning algorithms are used in order to classify the iris flower. Algorithm used for predicting the class and determine accuracy are:

Logistic Regression
Support Vector Machine
KNN-Neighbors
GaussianNB
Decision tree classifier
